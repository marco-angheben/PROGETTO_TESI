# How was it made

The frontend is made with Vue.js and a Node.js to serve it. I used the VueSax UI library and axios for the requests. I also used typescript with Vuejs in order to have a cleaner code.

# How to run it

To run the frontend:

* Install nodejs on your machine
* Clone this repo )
* Open the root folder in a terminal
* Execute `npm run frontend:install` (an alternative could be `cd vuejs && npm install`) to install the frontend dependencies
* Execute `npm install` to install the nodejs server dependencies
* Execute `npm run frontend:build` (an alternative could be `cd vuejs && npm run build`) to build the frontend
* Execute `npm start` to start the frontend server
* You can now open your browser on the address 'http://localhost:8000'
